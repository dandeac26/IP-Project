****
<h4> Student: Deac Dan Cristian</h4>

# Requirements : 

**Interesting special effects on color images**.
  
  •	you’ll study some interesting special effects that can be applied on color images.
  
  •	you’ll implement a set of them (the number depends on the difficulty). 

# Description
This project implements different filters and “effects” to an image making use of the OpenCV computer vision library in C++. This is the documentation of the semester project of the Image processing Course. Alongside the laboratory work during the 2nd semester of 3rd year, I developed the ability to solve such problems and make use of this computer vision library.
